# AI Resume Screening Prototype

## Overview
This project is a full-stack prototype exploring how AI-assisted tools can support resume screening and early-stage candidate evaluation. The goal was to demonstrate practical system design and business-oriented thinking rather than build a production-ready product.

## Problem Statement
Recruiters and hiring managers often spend significant time manually reviewing resumes, many of which are poor matches for a role. This project explores how structured logic and AI assistance could help surface relevant candidates more efficiently.

## Architecture
- Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite)
- Backend: Node.js API
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- ORM: Drizzle
- Shared utilities and types in a monorepo structure

## How It Was Built
The initial prototype was developed in Replit using AI-assisted coding tools. The codebase was then organized and documented for clarity and portability outside the Replit environment.

## What I’d Improve Next
- Authentication and role-based access
- Improved resume parsing and scoring logic
- Model evaluation and bias considerations
- Deployment pipeline and environment configuration

## Tech Stack
React, TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Drizzle ORM
